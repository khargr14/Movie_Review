# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  movies = Movie.create([ 
  { title: 'THe sound of music', description: 'musical', director: 'unknown', movie_length: '3 hours', user_id: 1 }, 
  {},
  {}
  
  
  ])
  #director.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
